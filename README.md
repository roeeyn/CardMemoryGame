## Rules of Memory Game 

- You will start by flipping over one card
- If the next card you flip matches the cards should disappear.
- If the next card you flip does not match, the cards flip back.
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board.

This repo was inspired by one of the many [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) tutorials. Thank you very much!
